# MongoDB

This connector simplifies using MongoDB in an application running on Cloud Foundry with the [.NET MongoDB Driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/csharp/).

>NOTE: There are currently no dedicated samples for the MongoDB connector. You can see it in action in the Steeltoe fork of [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/eShopOnContainers), in the Locations API and the Marketing API.
